Sample projects for Tanya Evans.

1. Amazon Product Recommendation system: compared metrics for user-user, item-item, and Matrix Factorization models.
   
2. Shinkansen Travel Experience: Work in progress. Currently 1 neural network model with two runs. First run has original values and features resulting in 90% accuracy on test set. Second run deletes values in some features that were uninformative (similar proportions of satisfied vs dissatisfied passengers), resulting in 91% accuracy. To be complete: hyperparameter tuning; additional feature engineering, ideally comparing feature values with 60/40, 70/30, and 80/20 (significant) proportions of satisfied to dissatisfied passengers.

3. EdTech Lead Conversion: Used decision tree and random forest models. Examined key factors that resulted in leads converting to paid students.
