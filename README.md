Sample projects for Tanya Evans.

1. Amazon Product Recommendation system: compared metrics for user-user, item-item, and Matrix Factorization models.
   
2. Shinkansen Travel Experience: Work in progress. Currently 1 neural network model run twice, one after a feature engineering tweak. First run has original values and features resulting in 90% accuracy on test set. Second run deletes redundant values in some features, i.e., similar proportions of satisfied vs dissatisfied passengers, resulting in 91% accuracy.
   To do:
   * hyperparameter tuning;
   * additional feature engineering, ideally extracting values with 60/40, 70/30, and 80/20 proportions of satisfied to dissatisfied passengers
   * decision tree to extract highly weighted features

4. EdTech Lead Conversion: Used decision tree and random forest models. Examined key factors that resulted in leads converting to paid students. Some insights gained:
   * Persons who were referred were more likely to convert to leads
   * The company had a poorer conversion rate if they contacted the lead by phone.
